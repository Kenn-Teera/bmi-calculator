For the first project in week 1, I sometimes believe that I should start by creating a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) Tool. This is a great project for the basic knowledge you have just learned because it requires:

- Understanding packages and compliance
- Practicing with variables and data types
- Being able to write functions to divide work
- Using Flow Control (e.g. if/else, for) in the control system
